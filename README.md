+ disable "others", "cache" and "language-select" button functionality while offline (re-enable when online again!)

+ also cache "all" and custom life groups when caching all for offline use

+ cached data does not persist between app loads

## Future Functions
+ search/sort by name?

+ add hierarchical tree?
  + choose filter from hierarchy under taxon

## Bugs
+ still sometimes flicker when loading life group
